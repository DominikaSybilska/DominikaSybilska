### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently: a student of Computer Science in Economy. I wanted to show what we have been doing during our studies and what technologies we use to create the final projects.
Some of the projects have been focused only to show us how working in teams is. We learn some agile methodologies and we have tried to cooperate keeping the main agile rules.
Also, I just want to show that I am familiar with some programming basics.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: about manual testing and QA issues. I have also prepared myself to pass the ISTQB exam.

- 👯 I’m looking for: a job or intern as a manual tester or QA Engineer.

- 👩‍🎓 Currently I am learning with:
<ul>
<li>Udemy Courses such as:
<ul>
<li>The Complete 2023 Software Testing Bootcamp</li>
<li>Praktyczny kurs testowania oprogramowania</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Books such as:
<ul>
<li>Certyfikowany tester istqb. poziom podstawowy.</li>
<li>Ścieżka testera. certyfikat istqb w pytaniach i odpowiedziach</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

But I hope the list will be longer and longer after passing the exam.
